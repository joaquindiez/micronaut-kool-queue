## Kool Queue

# ðŸ§Š Kool Queue â€” Core Database Schema

Kool Queue is a lightweight, SQL-backed job queue for **Micronaut** applications.  
It provides a solid, observable, and resilient background job system inspired by Solid Queue and Sidekiq Pro patterns.

## ðŸ“š The Six Core Tables

| Table | Purpose | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **kool_queue_jobs** | Permanent record | Stores metadata and lifecycle info for every job ever created. |
| **kool_queue_ready_executions** | Active queue | Holds jobs ready to be executed **now**. Workers poll this table. |
| **kool_queue_scheduled_executions** | Scheduler queue | Contains jobs scheduled to run **later**. |
| **kool_queue_claimed_executions** | Running jobs | Keeps track of jobs that are **currently being executed**. |
| **kool_queue_failed_executions** | Failed jobs | Stores information about **jobs that failed** execution. |
| **kool_queue_processes** | Process monitor | Tracks **live worker processes** via heartbeat (every 60 seconds). |

## ðŸŽ¯ Job Lifecycle (Simplified)

```text
MyJob.perform_later(args)
  â†“
INSERT INTO kool_queue_jobs
INSERT INTO kool_queue_ready_executions
  â†“
Worker picks job:
  INSERT INTO kool_queue_claimed_executions
  DELETE FROM kool_queue_ready_executions
  â†“
Execute MyJob.perform(args)
  â†“
On success:
  UPDATE kool_queue_jobs SET finished_at = NOW
  DELETE FROM kool_queue_claimed_executions
```

Other specialized tables (for advanced features):

- **kool_queue_recurring_executions** â†’ recurring jobs (CRON)
- **kool_queue_blocked_executions** â†’ concurrency limits
- **kool_queue_semaphores** â†’ concurrency locks
- **kool_queue_pauses** â†’ paused queues

---

## âœ… Highlights

- **6 Core Tables** managing the full job lifecycle
- **Optimized indexes** for efficient worker polling (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`)
- **Heartbeat tracking** for worker processes
- **Transactional schema creation** for safe initialization
